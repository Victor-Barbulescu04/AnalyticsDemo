Instructions:
// You can bypass the first step but when setting this ip for the first time it can be beneficial for trouble shooting
1. Run the SADP.exe that is inside of SADP240312
	This will allow you to find any of the IP camera on the network in case the IP address has changed
2. Open your browser and type in the IP addess of the camera. Currently 10.199.178.17
	You can also access the camera by double clicking the ip address inside the SADP window
3. Enter the login credintials. You will not be able to see any footage yet as there is another plug in you must download and run
4. Run the LocalServiceComponent.exe or download it by clicking the "download plug-in" button in the top right of your camera web page
5. Run vlc-3.0.21-win64.exe and the open it up. 
6. In VLC click on media and select "Open Network Stream" drom the drop down
	Paste this into the network URL: rtsp://10.199.178.17:554
	If you get a pop-up asking you to login enter the username and password above
	If no pop-up appears check the RSTP port nmuber by going to your browser connection selecting configuration
		Then Network and port. This will then display the current RSTP port number
7. If the IP address of the camera has not changed open the batch file named "CameraStream.bat", leave this open. Then double click the batch file and run it
	The batch file will look like this:
		vlc.exe -vvv -Idummy rtsp://admin:Beckhoff@10.199.178.17:554 --sout #transcode{vcodec=MJPG,venc=ffmpeg{strict=1}}:standard{access=http{mime=multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=--7b3cc56e5f51db803f790dad720ed50a},mux=mpjpeg,dst=:8080/};
	If the IP address of the camera has changed adjust |		| to match the new IP. Additionally, if your RSTP has changed adjust the 554 value to get your connection.
8. with this running you will now be able to access your camera feed by connecting your IFrame to "http://127.0.0.1:8080". Adjust this as needed depending on your server location.
9. Make the connection and open your HMI in the browser. If there is no image there could be a long delay, in this case wait roughly 10 minutes to see if an image appears.
	If the image appears but is delayed from real time images, restart the computer running VLC and repeat steps 6 through 8.
	If a message pops up saying the connection has been refused contact either myself:
